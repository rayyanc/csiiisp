The top left is a wire. Wires carry current.


The next one is a wire that separates into more wires.


If you decide to wire with Bus, the next one which is the Bus Entry must connect to Bus and other nets with wires.


NetLabel can be used to give your wires names to help you find them and identify any misconnections.


NetFlag is the same as NetLabel. You can also change its name, for example from +5V to VDD.

Net Port works like Net Label, it doesn’t differentiate the input and output net port. When you don’t want to route too many wires, use Net Port.

No Connect Flag means don't connect the wires.
